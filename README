Geodesica is an open source game engine written in scala. It is designed to
support a wide variety of games and clients.

To run:

Build with SBT: https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki
In geodesica directory:
sbt run

To load the client( https://github.com/windmillium/geodesica-client ) I use nginx locally:

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name geo.42foo.com;
      location / {
        root /Users/lsheridan/Projects/geodesica/client;
      }

      location ~* ^/game {
        rewrite /game(.*) $1 break;
        proxy_pass http://geo.42foo.com:8888;
      }
    }

Then visit geo.42foo.com in a modern web browser.
